This is a vermicompost process
here we will describe about the prcess from scratch
let us excavate the pit upto 3 feet and put all the waste like leafes papers and food waste etc...
then fill the pit with mud wait for 10 to 15 days to see the compost,....
after completion of certain peroid open the pit we will find the compost...
use these compost to plants for better growth now a days huge farmers are using 
untraditional boostings to the palnts due to this outcomes are not growing with desired quality so to eradicate this we all try to do awarness on farmers to use traditional compost have a great day.
Thankyou,
