This is a vermicompost process
here we will describe about the prcess from scratch
let us excavate the land upto 3 feet and put all the waste like leaves papers and food waste etc...
then fill the pit with mud wait for 10 to 15 days to see the compost,....
after completion of certain peroid open the pit we will find the compost...
use these compost to plants for better growth.
Thankyou,
